= Kata repository for Poker Hands

This is a repository that can be used as a starting point for doing the Poker Hands kata, as described in http://www.codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?back=KataPokerHands

== TODO

This is just a first commit with a failing cucumber feature.

* I will add a reference implementation branch soon
* Integrate with Sensei (http://github.com/dtsato/sensei)

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
